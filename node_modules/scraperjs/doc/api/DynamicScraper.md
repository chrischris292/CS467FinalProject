DynamicScraper() 
-----------------------------
A dynamic scraper. This is a very versatile and powerful. This
  solution is a little heavier and slower than the {@see StaticScraper}.
This version uses phantomjs {@link http://phantomjs.org/}, and {@link https://github.com/sgentle/phantomjs-node}.


loadBody() 
-----------------------------

scrape(scraperFn, callbackFn, args) 
-----------------------------
The scraper function has it's own scope (can't access outside its
  own scope), and only JSON serializable information can be return
  by the function. For more information {@link https://github.com/sgentle/phantomjs-node}.

**Parameters**

**scraperFn**: function, Function to scrape the content.
  It receives the args as parameters, if passed.

**callbackFn**: function, Function that receives the
  result of the scraping.

**args**: Array, Additional arguments to pass to the scraping
  function. They must be JSON serializable.

**Returns**: AbstractScraper, This scraper.

inject(file, callback) 
-----------------------------
Injects a javascript file into the page.

**Parameters**

**file**: string, File to inject.

**callback**: function, Function to be called
  when the file has injected. If the injection fails, then the
  first argument is not is a {@see ScraperError}.


close() 
-----------------------------

clone() 
-----------------------------

create(url) 
-----------------------------
Creates a dynamic scraper, wrapped around a scraper promise.

**Parameters**

**url**: string, If provided makes an HTTP GET request to the
  given URL.

**Returns**: ScraperPromise, Scraper promise, with a dynamic scraper.

startFactory() 
-----------------------------
Starts the factory. A factory should only be open once, and after
  it's open it must be closed with {@see DynamicScraper#closeFactory}.
  A factory makes so that there's only one instance of phantom at a
  time, which makes the creation/usage of dynamic scrapers much
  more efficient.

**Returns**: DynamicScraper, Starts the factory. A factory should only be open once, and after
  it's open it must be closed with {@see DynamicScraper#closeFactory}.
  A factory makes so that there's only one instance of phantom at a
  time, which makes the creation/usage of dynamic scrapers much

closeFactory() 
-----------------------------
Closes the factory. For more information {@see DynamicScraper#closeFactory}

**Returns**: DynamicScraper, Closes the factory. For more information {@see DynamicScraper#closeFactory}
