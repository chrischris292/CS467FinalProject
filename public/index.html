    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <line class = "other"></line>
    <p>    
        Inspired by the research papers that we critiqued in class, we set out with the goal to discover potential patterns or biases in different areas of academia. 
        We created a research paper data set by aggregating articles for areas of academia including Computer Science, Biology, and Psychology. For each academic area, we have three subcategories which split the data further. Afterwards, we applied sentiment analysis and similarity algorithms to the papers to draw comparisons between the subjects.
    </p>

    <h1>Neutrality Among Academic Areas</h1>
    <line class = "other"></line>
    <p>    
        Our goal was to see which academic area is the most neutral in terms of written style. Using sentiment analysis tools, we calculated an average neutrality score on a scale from 0 to 1 where 0 represents the least neutral and 1 represents the most neutral. We ran analysis on both the full texts of the research papers for each category as well as a summarized version of the text.
    </p>

    <p>
        In terms of neutrality, we found academic papers in Biology had higher scores compared to Computer Science and Psychology. The summarized versions of the papers resulted in lower neutrality scores overall. This may be attributed to the fact that the summary tools focused on parts of the papers where data was explained rather than given, though it is important to note that not all summary tools are perfect in capturing the ideas behind each paper.
    </p>

    <p>
        Along with the neutrality score, there is a polarity score broken down into negative and positive polarity. The scores also range from 0 to 1, where 0 represents the least polar and 1 the most. The sum of the negative and positive polarity scores equal 1. For our analysis, we converted this number to a percentage to more easily compare the difference in sentiment.
